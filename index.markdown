# Welcome to F136 - the gematik technology blog
The gematik technology blog was created to give back to the community. As open source is part of our DNA, we do not only share our work results on GitHub but also want to share the stories behind them.
We hope it helps people to prevent making mistakes we made and motivates them to explore technologies for modern healthcare!

The name "F136" is not a new stealth fighter airplane but derives from our location in the heart of Berlin, at Friedrichstrasse 136. It's a commonly used internal term for our office.

Have fun reading at the gematik tech blog!
