# gematik's technology blog


This is a place where we would like to give back to the community by telling our story from the technology front line of the German Healthcare system.

We've seen a lot of technologies come and go in the past years, we also tried a few things in our engineering organization, so maybe people find a few interesting things or even inspiration from that.

## Installation
The blog is based on [github-pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll) with [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) and the pages theme ['minimal'](https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal).

Make sure to install the latest version of [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) and [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) before running it locally.
